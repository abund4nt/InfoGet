# InfoGet
**InfoGet** is a command line tool that passively collects information using the Wayback Machine API, it reports directories and/or files that could be exposed in the given domain.

It should be clarified that not everything reported by the tool is valid, there are files that were probably deleted over time or for some other reason are no longer there, so it is very important to verify them.
